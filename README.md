### Hi I'm JuanjoQuero!


**Aspiring data scientist** 

***After getting enrolled into a HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp, 
I've found a fulfilling passion and decided to transition into a tech career.***

I'm currently open to job offers, looking for an internship to apply my new set of skills.
I'm interested in Machine Learning, AI and Data visualisations. 
Right now learning SQL and thinking what it would be the next language to learn, for now only Python,
but if I've learned anything in this course is that this is a neverending learning joyful journey.
Looking forward to collaborate in any project that help me get some onsite experience.
